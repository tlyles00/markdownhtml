<p>Mrs. Lyles is an aspirng tech student. Along with being a tech student Mrs.Lyles is also a mother of 
    two handsome boys. Mrs. Lyles is also a full-time worker who is in the insurance industry. 
    Making the change from the insurcance world to the tech world was definitely a leap of faith for Mrs. Lyles
    But making this change is apart of many ways to show her boys that they can do anything that they put their minds
    to.
